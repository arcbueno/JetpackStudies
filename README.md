# JetpackStudies

- Repository created for store all the code created while I study the Android Jetpack
- To see what i've done, go to the issues
- In the end, we have a new To-do app, implemented with Data Binding, Fragment Navigation, Room and Live Data.
- The next step is create an To-do API with python (and django) to store all to-do data and do this app use the API via Retrofit.
- For an example of an app made with retrofit, go view my [The One App](https://github.com/arcbueno/TheOneApp)

Thank You!
